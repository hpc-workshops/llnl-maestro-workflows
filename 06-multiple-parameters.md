## Adding a second parameter

In this episode, we want to vary `P`, the fraction of parallel code,
as part of our workflow. To do this, we will add a second entry under
`global.parameters` and remove the definition for `P` under `env`:

```yml
(...)
env:
    variables:
      OUTPUT: amdahl.json
      OUTPUT_PATH: ./Episode6

(...)

global.parameters:
    TASKS:
        values: [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
        label: TASKS.%%
    P:
        values: [<Insert values>]
        label: P.%%
```

How many values do we want to include for `P`? We need to have __the
same number__ of values listed for all `global.parameters`. This
means that to run the previous scaling study with `P=.5`, and five
values for `TASKS`, our global parameters section would specify `.5`
for `P` five times:

```yml
global.parameters:
    TASKS:
        values: [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
        label: TASKS.%%
    P:
        values: [.5, .5, .5, .5, .5]
        label: P.%%
```

Let's say we want to perform the same scaling study for a second value
of P, `.99`. This means that we'd have to repeat the same 5 values for
`TASKS` and then provide the second value of `P` 5 times:

```yml
global.parameters:
    TASKS:
        values: [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
        label: TASKS.%%
    P:
        values: [.5, .5, .5, .5, .5, .99, .99, .99, .99, .99]
        label: P.%%
```

At this point, our entire YAML file should look something like

```yml
description:
    name: Amdahl
    description: Run a parallel program

batch:
    type: slurm
    host: quartz  # machine to run on
    bank: guests  # bank
    queue: pdebug # partition

env:
    variables:
      OUTPUT: amdahl.json
      OUTPUT_PATH: ./Episode6

study:
    - name: run-amdahl
      description: run in parallel
      run:
          # Here's where we include our MPI wrapper:
          cmd: |
               $(LAUNCHER) amdahl --terse -p $(P) >> $(OUTPUT)
          nodes: 1
          procs: $(TASKS)
          walltime: "00:01:30"
    - name: plot
      description: Create a plot from `amdahl` results
      run:
          cmd: |
               python3 $(SPECROOT)/plot_terse_amdahl_results.py output.jpg $(run-amdahl.workspace)/TASKS.*/amdahl.json
          depends: [amdahl_*]

global.parameters:
    TASKS:
        values: [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
        label: TASKS.%%
    P:
        values: [.5, .5, .5, .5, .5, .99, .99, .99, .99, .99]
        label: P.%%
```

::: challenge

Run the workflow above. Do you generate `output.jpg`? If not, why not?

::::::solution

If you use the YAML above, your `amdahl-run` steps should work, but
your `plot` step will fail. `plot`'s failure will be evident both
because `output.jpg` will be missing from the `plot` subdirectory
__and__ because the `plot.*.err` file in the same directory will
contain an error:

```output
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "plot_terse_amdahl_results.py", line 46, in <module>
    process_files(filenames, output=output)
  File "plot_terse_amdahl_results.py", line 10, in process_files
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '~/Episode6/Amdahl_20240328-163359/run-amdahl/TASKS.*/amdahl.json'
```

The problem is that the directory path for `.json` files has changed.
This will be discussed more below!
::::::
:::

The trouble with the YAML above is that our output directory structure
changed when we added a second global parameter, but we didn't update
the directory path specified under `plot`.

If we look inside the `run-amdahl` output folder (identified
as `$(run-amdahl.workspace)` in our workflow YAML), its
subdirectory names now include information about both
global parameters:

```bash
ls Episode6/Amdahl_20240328-163359/run-amdahl
```

``` output
P.0.5.TASKS.16  P.0.5.TASKS.8    P.0.99.TASKS.4
P.0.5.TASKS.2   P.0.99.TASKS.16  P.0.99.TASKS.8
P.0.5.TASKS.32  P.0.99.TASKS.2
P.0.5.TASKS.4   P.0.99.TASKS.32
```

whereas directory path for our `.json` files is specified
as `$(run-amdahl.workspace)/TASKS.*/amdahl.json` under the `plot`
step.

We could get the `plot` step to work by simply
adding a wildcard, `*`, in front of `TASKS` so that the
path to `.json` files would be

```yml
$(run-amdahl.workspace)/*TASKS.*/amdahl.json
```

and the definition for `plot` would be

```yml
    - name: plot
      description: Create a plot from `amdahl` results
      run:
          cmd: |
               python3 $(SPECROOT)/plot_terse_amdahl_results.py output.jpg $(run-amdahl.workspace)/*TASKS.*/amdahl.json
          depends: [amdahl_*]
```

This would allow `plot` to terminate happily and to produce an
`output.jpg` file, but that image would plot output from all `.json`
files as a single line, and we wouldn't be able to tell which data
points corresponded to a parallel fraction, $P=0.85$ and which
corresponded to $P=0.99$.

If we can generate two plots -- one for each value of `P` -- we'll
more clearly be able to see scaling behavior for these two
situations. We can generate two separate plots by calling `python3
plot_terse_amdahl_results.py ...` on two sets of input files -- those
in the `P.0.5.TASKS*` subdirectories of `$(run-amdahl.workspace)` and
those in the `P.0.99.TASKS*` subdirectories.

That means we can generate these two plots by inserting the variable
`$(P)` into the path --

```yml
$(run-amdahl.workspace)/P.$(P).TASKS.*/amdahl.json
```

making the definition for `plot`

```yml
    - name: plot
      description: Create a plot from `amdahl` results
      run:
          cmd: |
               python3 $(SPECROOT)/plot_terse_amdahl_results.py output.jpg $(run-amdahl.workspace)/P.$(P).TASKS.*/amdahl.json
          depends: [amdahl_*]
```

::: challenge

Modify your workflow as discussed above to generate output plots for
two different values of P. Open these plots and verify they are
different from each other.  How does changing the workflow to generate
two separate plots change the directory structure?

(Feel free to use .5 and .99 or to modify to other values of your
choosing.)

:::::: solution

Your full YAML file should be similar to

```yml
description:
    name: Amdahl
    description: Run a parallel program

batch:
    type: slurm
    host: quartz # machine to run on
    bank: guests # bank
    queue: pdebug # partition

env:
    variables:
      OUTPUT: amdahl.json
      OUTPUT_PATH: ./Episode6

study:
    - name: run-amdahl
      description: run in parallel
      run:
          # Here's where we include our MPI wrapper:
          cmd: |
               $(LAUNCHER) amdahl --terse -p $(P) >> $(OUTPUT)
          nodes: 1
          procs: $(TASKS)
          walltime: "00:01:30"
    - name: plot
      description: Create a plot from `amdahl` results
      run:
          cmd: |
               python3 $(SPECROOT)/plot_terse_amdahl_results.py output.jpg $(run-amdahl.workspace)/P.$(P).TASKS.*/amdahl.json
          depends: [amdahl_*]

global.parameters:
    TASKS:
        values: [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
        label: TASKS.%%
    P:
        values: [.5, .5, .5, .5, .5, .99, .99, .99, .99, .99]
        label: P.%%
```

Modifying `plot` to include `$(P)` caused this step to run twice.  As
a result, two subdirectories under `plot` were created -- one for each
value of P:

```bash
ls Episode6/Amdahl_20240328-171343/plot
```

``` output
P.0.5  P.0.99
```

::: callout

Instead of modifying the path to our `amdahl.json` files to
`$(run-amdahl.workspace)/P.$(P).TASKS.*/amdahl.json`, we
could have equivalently updated it to
`$(run-amdahl.workspace)/$(P.label).TASKS.*/amdahl.json`.

In other words, `P.$(P)` is equivalent to `$(P.label)`.
Similarly, in Maestro, `TASKS.$(TASKS)` is equivalent to
`$(TASKS.label)`. This syntax works for every global parameter
in Maestro.

- "Multiple parameters can be defined under `global.parameters`."
- "Lists of values for all global parameters must have the same
  length; the Nth entries in the lists of values for all global
